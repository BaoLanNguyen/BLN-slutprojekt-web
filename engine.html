    <h1 class="greet">What are game engines?</h1>
    <div class="desc">
        <p>A game engine is a software framework primarily designed for the development of video games, 
        and generally includes relevant libraries and support programs. The "engine" terminology is similar to the term "software engine" used in the software industry.
        Game engine can also refer to the development software utilizing this framework, 
        typically offering a suite of tools and features for developing games. 
        Developers can use game engines to construct games for video game consoles and other types of computers. 
        The core functionality typically provided by a game engine may include a rendering engine ("renderer") for 2D or 3D graphics, 
        a physics engine or collision detection (and collision response), sound, scripting, animation, artificial intelligence, networking, 
        streaming, memory management, threading, localization support, scene graph, and video support for cinematics.
        Game engine implementers often economize on the process of game development by reusing/adapting, in large part, 
        the same game engine to produce different games or to aid in porting games to multiple platforms.</p>

        <p>Unity is a cross-platform game engine developed by Unity Technologies, 
            first announced and released in June 2005 at Apple Inc.'s Worldwide Developers Conference as a Mac OS X-exclusive game engine.
            The engine has since been gradually extended to support a variety of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms. 
            It is particularly popular for iOS and Android mobile game development and used for games such as Pok√©mon Go,
            Monument Valley, Call of Duty: Mobile, Beat Saber and Cuphead. It is considered easy to use for beginner developers and is popular for indie game development.
            The engine can be used to create three-dimensional and two-dimensional games, as well as interactive simulations and other experiences. 
            The engine has been adopted by industries outside video gaming, such as film, automotive, architecture, engineering, construction, and the United States Armed Forces.</p>

        <p>Unreal Engine (UE) is a 3D computer graphics game engine developed by Epic Games, first showcased in the 1998 first-person shooter game Unreal. 
            Initially developed for PC first-person shooters, it has since been used in a variety of genres of three-dimensional (3D) games and has seen adoption by other industries,
            most notably the film and television industry. Written in C++, the Unreal Engine features a high degree of portability, 
            supporting a wide range of desktop, mobile, console and virtual reality platforms.

            The latest generation, Unreal Engine 5, was launched in April 2022. As its predecessor released in March 2014, 
            its source code is available on GitHub after registering an account, and commercial use is granted based on a royalty model. 
            Epic waives their royalties margin for games until developers have earned US$1 million in revenue and the fee is waived if developers publish on the Epic Games Store. 
            Epic has included features from acquired companies like Quixel in the engine, which is seen as helped by Fortnite's revenue.</p>

    <div class="makerte">
        <p>GameMaker (originally Animo and later Game Maker until 2011) is a series of cross-platform game engines created by Mark Overmars in 1999 and developed by YoYo Games 
            since 2007. The latest iteration is GameMaker Studio 2, released in 2017.
            GameMaker accommodates the creation of cross-platform and multi-genre video games using a custom drag-and-drop visual programming language 
            or a scripting language known as Game Maker Language, which can be used to develop more advanced games that could not be created just by using 
            the drag and drop features. GameMaker was originally designed to allow novice computer programmers to be able to make computer games without much programming 
            knowledge by use of these actions. Recent versions of software also focus on appealing to advanced developers.</p>
