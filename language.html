                C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language. C# encompasses static typing, 
                strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented (class-based), and component-oriented programming disciplines. 
                C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg from Microsoft in 2000 and was later approved as an international standard
                Microsoft introduced C# along with .NET Framework and Visual Studio, both of which were closed-source. 
                At the time, Microsoft had no open-source products. Four years later, in 2004, a free and open-source project called Mono began, 
                providing a cross-platform compiler and runtime environment for the C# programming language. A decade later, Microsoft released Visual Studio Code (code editor), Roslyn (compiler),
                and the unified .NET platform (software framework), all of which support C# and are free, open-source, and cross-platform. 
                Mono also joined Microsoft but was not merged into .NET.
                As of 2021, the most recent version of the language is C# 10.0, which was released in 2021 in .NET 6.0.

            Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.
            Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), 
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.
            Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. 
            Python 3.0, released in 2008, 
            was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.

            JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, 
            alongside HTML and CSS. Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. 
            All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
            JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, 
            and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. 
            It has application programming interfaces for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

                Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
                CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.
                This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; 
                enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; 
                and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.                
                Separation of formatting and content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, 
                such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. 
                CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if the content is accessed on a mobile device.
