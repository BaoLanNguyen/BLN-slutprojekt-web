            <legend>What is video game development?</legend>
            <p>Video game development is the process of developing a video game. The effort is undertaken by a
                developer,
                ranging from a single person to an international team dispersed across the globe. Development of
                traditional commercial PC and console games is normally
                funded by a publisher, and can take several years to reach completion. Indie games usually take less
                time and money and can be produced by individuals and smaller
                developers. The independent game industry has been on the rise, facilitated by the growth of accessible
                game development software such as Unity platform and Unreal
                Engine and new online distribution systems such as Steam and Uplay,
                as well as the mobile game market for Android and iOS devices.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="all">
            <legend>Producer</legend>
            <p>Development is overseen by internal and external producers. The producer working for the developer is
                known as the internal producer and manages the development team,
                schedules, reports progress, hires and assigns staff, and so on. The producer working for the publisher
                is known as the external producer and oversees developer
                progress and budget. Producer's responsibilities include PR, contract negotiation, liaising between the
                staff and stakeholders,
                schedule and budget maintenance, quality assurance, beta test management, and localization.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="all">
            <legend>Publisher</legend>
            <p>A video game publisher is a company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally
                or have had developed by an external video game developer.
                As with book publishers or publishers of DVD movies, video game publishers are responsible for their
                product's manufacturing and marketing,
                including market research and all aspects of advertising.
                They usually finance the development, sometimes by paying a video game developer
                (the publisher calls this external development) and sometimes by paying an internal staff of developers
                called a studio. Consequently,
                they also typically own the IP of the game. Large video game publishers also distribute the games they
                publish, while some smaller publishers instead hire
                distribution companies (or larger video game publishers) to distribute the games they publish.</p>

        <fieldset class="all">
            <legend>Designer</legend>
            <p>A game designer is a person who designs gameplay, conceiving and designing the rules and structure of a
                game.
                Development teams usually have a lead designer who coordinates the work of other designers. They are the
                main visionary of the game.
                One of the roles of a designer is being a writer, often employed part-time to conceive game's narrative,
                dialogue, commentary, cutscene narrative, journals,
                video game packaging content, hint system, etc.
                In larger projects, there are often separate designers for various parts of the game, such as, game
                mechanics, user interface, characters, dialogue, graphics, etc.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="all">
            <legend>Artist</legend>
            <p>A game artist is a visual artist who creates video game art. The art production is usually overseen by an
                art director or art lead, making sure their vision is followed.
                The art director manages the art team, scheduling and coordinating within the development team.
                The artist's job may be 2D oriented or 3D oriented. 2D artists may produce concept art, sprites,
                textures, environmental backdrops or terrain images,
                and user interface. 3D artists may produce models or meshes, animation, 3D environment, and cinematics.
                Artists sometimes occupy both roles.</p>

        <fieldset class="all">
            <legend>Programmer</legend>
            <p>A game programmer is a software engineer who primarily develops video games or related software (such as
                game development tools).
                The game's codebase development is handled by programmers.There are usually one to several lead
                programmers, who implement the game's starting codebase
                and overview future development and programmer allocation on individual modules. An entry-level
                programmer can make, on average,
                around $70,000 annually and an experienced programmer can make, on average, around $125,000 annually.

            <legend>sound engineer</legend>
            <p>Sound engineers are technical professionals responsible for sound effects and sound positioning. They are
                sometimes involved in creating haptic feedback,
                as was the case with the Returnal game sound team at PlayStation Studios Creative Arts' in London.
                They sometimes oversee voice acting and other sound asset creation.
                Composers who create a game's musical score also comprise a game's sound team, though often this work is
                outsourced.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="last">
            <legend>Tester</legend>
            <p>The quality assurance is carried out by game testers. A game tester analyzes video games to document
                software defects as part of a quality control.
                Testing is a highly technical field requiring computing expertise, and analytic competence.
                The testers ensure that the game falls within the proposed design: it both works and is entertaining.
                This involves testing of all features, compatibility, localization, etc.
                Although, necessary throughout the whole development process, testing is expensive and is often actively
                utilized only towards the completion of the project.</p>
