                <h2>About this website</h2>
                <p>This website was made as a final project for the course webbutveckling 1. The theme of the website is
                    information technologies as required in the assignment.
                    Everything was designed by one person. The person who created this website is fairly new to web
                    development and web design, so the website has many flaws and poorly designed layouts.

                <p>Teknikum is an upper secondary school (in Swedish called gymnasieskola) located in Växjö, Sweden.
                    The school was founded in 1961 as an engineering school, offering three-year programs in mechanical,
                    chemical, electrical and construction engineering,
                    with an optional fourth year providing the degree of gymnasieingenjör. Although the latter was a
                    professional degree (awarded until 1992),
                    a large share of the students continued their education at university level, e.g. as Master of
                    Science in Engineering.
                    Since the 1990s the focus on engineering has diminished, and the school offers a wide range of
                    secondary level educational programs.</p>
